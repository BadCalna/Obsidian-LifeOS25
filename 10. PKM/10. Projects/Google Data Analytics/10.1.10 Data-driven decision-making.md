- **Using Facts to guide business strategy**

> [!example]
> Question: Is having a manager valuable? Or just consider everyone as an individual contributor?
- What does the data analyst team do?
	- based on at past performance reviews and employee surveys, they plotted those data **on graph**(*visualization*)
		- Graph says that Googlers had **positive** attitude towards their manager
		  *but the data is general*
	- They want to learn more, so they split the origin data into [[Quartiles]]
		- Find out that there was a big difference between **the very top** and **the very bottom** quartiles
		  *the teams with the best managers were significantly happier, more productive, and more likely to want to keep working at Google.
	- Therefore, only individual contributor plan is dead.
- But that's not an end for haven't leading to actionable insights, so they:
	- First, an award program for employees to nominate their favorite managers, For every submission you had to provide examples or data about what makes that manager great
	- Second, they compared the successful and less successful manager's behavior.
