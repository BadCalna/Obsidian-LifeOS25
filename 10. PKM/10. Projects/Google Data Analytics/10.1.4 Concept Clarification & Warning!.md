## Concept clarifying

### Data Ecosystem
---
**Definition**
- A data ecosystem is like any other ecosystem: a group of elements that interact with each other. In this case, those elements are hardware and software tools, the people who use them, and the data itself.
- The cloud is a key part of the data ecosystem, allowing data to be stored and accessed online.
### **Data Scientists vs. Data Analysts**
---
- While often confused, data scientists and data analysts have distinct roles.
- Data scientists create **new ways** to model and understand data, essentially formulating new questions.
  **Data science** is *Creating new ways of modeling and understandingthe unknown by using raw data*
> 本质上是提出新问题
- Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on finding answers to existing questions using data.
### WARNING:  **==gut instinct can do harm on case!
