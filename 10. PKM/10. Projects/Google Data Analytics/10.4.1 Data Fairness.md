> [!important] ## Topic: Data Fairness
- **Fairness** means to ensure your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias
	- Right ≠ Fair
- ***It's important to think about fairness from the moment you start collecting data for a business task to the time you present your conclusions to your stakeholders.***
- if the analysis is not objective, the conclusions can be misleading and even harmful.

> [!Tips] ## Key takeaways
- As a data professional, you will need to ensure you always consider fairness. This will allow you to avoid creating or reinforcing bias or accidentally drawing misleading conclusions. Using these best practices can help guide your analysis and make you a better data professional!

> [!note] ## Self-Reflection
- To me, it's just about to consider in a full-page, not conclude using partial data.
