## Context
---
The movies Mega-Pik has released recently aren’t having the impact they used to. Five of their last six releases barely broke even at the box office, and the sixth film lost a lot of money. 
The lead executives at Mega-Pik have noticed that their competitors went through a similar slump,
> slump n. 低谷期

but recovered when they started producing remakes of past successes and marketing them to a new audience.
Mega-Pik is interested in following this trend. **So they hired your team** to do data-based decision to ***help them make popular movies again.***
Specially, they asked for [[EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)|EDA]].

## Processing
---
Then you and your team start working...
### Ask
---
Set following goals for Mega-Pik:
- Identify key factors that contribute to a movie's opening weekend success.
- Understand the relationship between a movie's budget and its revenue.
- Determine which genres are most successful.
> 识别出导致电影首映周末成功的关键因素；
> 理解电影预算与电影收入的关系
> 确定哪种类型（的电影）是最成功的

### Prepare
---
Then you need to collect proper data into the dataset.
> My answer: movie name, release date, movie type, star actors, box office, opening weekend revenue, movie cost, budget

Turns out to be the right dataset includes follow columns:
- [x] Movie name
- [x] Release date
- [ ] Opening night revenue
- [x] Opening weekend revenue
- [x] Budget (cost to create)
- [x] Marketing costs
- [ ] Ratings
- [x] Genre

### **now you can use your skills!**
- #### Curiosity
	- it will help you come up with questions you can answer
	- eg. you might wonder if there’s a relationship between a **movie’s budget** and the **revenue** it generates on opening night or over the opening weekend. You might also be curious about combining columns to make new metrics, such as which genres tend to perform better on opening weekend—both overall and in the seasons in which the movies were released. You might even ask if there should be additional columns of data that you don’t already have, such as audience demographics.

- #### Understanding context
	- Context is crucial for any kind of meaningful data analysis. Analysts determine context by looking for patterns or anomalies in a dataset.
	- For example, **family films** typically generate more revenue when **children are on vacation from school**.
		- Further the “season” in which children are on vacation from school differs by country, which is another contextual clue you have to take into account.

> 分析师通过在数据集中寻找模式或异常值来确定context（数据背景）
> 了解context帮助你找出更多有意义的见解 

- #### Technical mindset
	- approaching problems(or dataset) in a systematic and logic way
	- problems aren't always technical, but a technical mindset is the skill that you use to break down any complex issue into manageable parts.
> 系统和逻辑的方式对待问题（以及数据集）。

- #### Data design
	- it's an extension of your technical mindset 
	- For example, you might organize the data by revenue and then by genre, which could reveal that comedies are more profitable than dramas. 
	- **Basically, how you choose to structure your data makes analysis easier and more insightful.
- #### Data Strategy
  像是资源分配策略
	- Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.
		- In this scenario, think of it as the approach you use to analyze your dataset. One element might be the tools you use. If Mega-Pik wants a relatively **simple** dashboard, you might use ==Google Sheets or Excel== because there are only a few columns of data. On the other hand, if Mega-Pik wants a dashboard where information **updates every time new data comes in**, you’d need a robust tool like ==Tableau==.
	- The data strategy you select should be based on the dataset and the deliverables
