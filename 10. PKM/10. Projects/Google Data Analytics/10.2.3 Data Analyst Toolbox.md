> [!important] ## Topic 
- Introduce Data Analyst Toolbox, including 
	- Spreadsheets 
	- Query Language
	- Visualization Tool

>[!Notes] ## Notes
- ## Spreadsheets
	- There are two main solutions:
		- ### Microsoft Excel
		- ### Google Sheets
		- Maybe *WPS Sheet* as well
	- **Function**
		- Collect, store, organize, and sort information
		- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
		- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.
	- **Features**
		- Formula: a set of **instructions** that performs specific calculation using data in a spreadsheet
			- eg. add, subtract, multiple, divide, average num of a number set, sum up the numbers that meet some particular conditions 
		- Functions: a preset **command** that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet
- ## Query Language
	- A computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a dataset/database
		- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
		- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
		- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis
	- eg. SQL
- ## Visualization Tool
	-  Two common solutions: 
		- Tableau
		- Looker
	- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
	- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies
	- **Features**
		- **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheet;  
		- **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual
tool you choose
> [!example] ## Difference between Spreadsheets and Database

| Spreadsheets                                | Databases                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Accessed through a software application     | Database accessed using a query language      |
| Structured data in a row and column format  | Structured data using rules and relationships |
| Organizes information in cells              | Organizes information in complex collections  |
| Provides access to a limited amount of data | Provides access to huge amounts of data       |
| Manual data entry                           | Strict and consistent data entry              |
| Generally one user at a time                | Multiple users                                |
| Controlled by the user                      | Controlled by a database management system    |

> [!note] ## Self-Reflection
- The choice of data analysis tools depends on the specific task at hand. Spreadsheets are suitable for ==organizing, cleaning, and analyzing **small to** **medium** datasets==. Databases are ideal for ==storing, managing, and analyzing **large and complex datasets**==. Data analysts often use a combination of spreadsheets, databases, and programming languages to effectively handle a wide range of data analysis tasks.
