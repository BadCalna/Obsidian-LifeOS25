## Tableau
---
- **Tableau** is a popular data visualization tool that lets you pull data from nearly any system and turn it into compelling visuals or actionable insights. The platform offers built-in visual best practices, which makes analyzing and sharing data fast, easy, and (most importantly) useful. Tableau works well with a wide variety of data and includes an interactive dashboard that lets you and your stakeholders click to explore the data interactively.
## R-language
---
- A lot of data analysts work with a programming language called R. Most people who work with R end up also using RStudio, an integrated developer environment (**IDE**), for their data visualization needs. As with Tableau, you can create dashboard-style data visualizations using RStudio.A lot of data analysts work with a programming language called R.
