	- Takes the time to fully understand ***stakeholder*** expectations
	- which means **determining** ==WHO== the stakeholders are, ==WHAT== they want, ==WHEN ==they want it, ==WHY ==they want it, and ==HOW== best to communicate with them
	- Defines the **problem to be solved**
		- looking at the current state and identifying the ways in which it’s different from the ideal state
	- Decides which questions to answer in order to solve the problem
